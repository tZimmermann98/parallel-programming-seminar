# Parallel Programming Seminar
This repository contains source files and seminar paper from a project in context of the seminar parallel programming at the university of münster.

The goal was to implement sequential and parallel versions of the data operations map, zip, and reduce. Afterwards a runtime comparison was carried out on PALMA, the high-perofrmace-computing clutster from the university of münster.
